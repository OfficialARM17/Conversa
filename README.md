Conversa
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
Conversa is the main chat application for my final year project and works by allowing the user to
have the following functionality:

  - Log In/Sign Up
  - Two-Factor Authentication
  - Search for Users
  - Chat with Users
  - Update Profile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features

Logging In/Signing Up - Three Stage Log In/Sign Up System where the user can enter the 
application with two-factor authentication present so that users can have the following
benefits:

  - Protecttion against Phishing
  - Reduced Risk of Unauthorised Access
  - Meeting Requirements

Searching for Users - Pressing the search icon on the top right of the screen opens a search 
menu where users can look for people to chat with and using the Firebase Database will allow
for this.

Chatting with Users - A user will be able to talk to others with convential text messaging,
speech-to-text and sign language translation with ConversaImageProcessing downloaded on the
same device. Previous Chat History will be loaded and Text-to-Speech functionality is present
with "Chat Last Message" button on the top right

Update Profile - Users are able to customise their name and profile picture with the Settings
page on the top-left of the home screen. Here, a user can change those details and log out.
